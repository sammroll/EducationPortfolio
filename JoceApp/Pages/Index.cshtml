                    Hello! My name is Jocelyn Roldan. Currently I am at National Louis University earning a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education with a concentration in bilingual education. I am expected to graduate this June! I have also attended Oakton Community College where I also earned my Associates degree in Early Childhood Education. At the moment I would be more than happy to teach at any grade level since through my years at college I've gained a decent experience with different grade levels.

                    But something that I would be interested in teaching would be being in a dual language classroom since I am able to speak two languages being English and Spanish so I think including both languages in the room can be very beneficial to the student! Some personal things that I enjoy doing in my free time would be free painting, doing arts and crafts, as well as doing legos

                <p align="left">
                    To conclude, the reason why I am very passionate about teaching is because I enjoy seeing my students grow throughout the year and seeing how far they come and blossom to who they are now
